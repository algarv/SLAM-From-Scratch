     Conceptual questions -2 [See README.md]
     
     Code works?
          - [Transform2D() default constructor is not defined or tested] -2
          - The following test cases fail: -1
       
        Transform2D tfin;
        stringstream ss2;
        ss2 << "45 -1 7";
        ss2 >> tfin;
        CHECK(tfin.rotation() == Approx(PI/4.0));
        CHECK(tfin.translation().x == Approx(-1));
        CHECK(tfin.translation().y == Approx(7));

       1. (minor) Your Vector2D and Transform2D output should not put a newline at the end.

    General CPP comments
      1. Use member initializer lists and delegating constructors when writing classes 2. Don't have unnecessary static variables
      3. Don't use arrays, use std::vector
      Lots of comments are inline on lines starting with //rec: see rigid2d.hpp/rigid2d.cpp

Task C.
   roslaunch nusim.launch

Overall:
This was a good assignment that met most of the goals.
I suggest taking a look at my C++ recommendations, there are small but important ways to improve your code.
