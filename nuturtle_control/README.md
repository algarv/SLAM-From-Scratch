# Experiments Demonstrating Real-World Odometry Performance
For each experiment, I recorded the initial and final odometry state estimation. 


## Experiment 1: 
*Drive the robot straight forward then backwards to its starting point*

Position

Start: (1, 1, 0)

End: (1.00, 1.00, 0)


## Experiment 2:
*Rotate the robot in place counter clockwise and clockwise, stopping in the initial orientation*

Orientation

Start: (0, 0, 0, 1)

End: (0, 0, 0.00715, 0.99997)


## Experiment 3:
*Drive the robot in a circle, stopping in the initial position and orientation*

Position

Start: (1, 1, 0)

End: (1.09, 0.984, 0)


## Experiment 4:
*Drive the robot in a circle, stopping in the initial position and orientation*

Position

Start: (1, 1, 0)

End: (1.011, 1.021, 0)

## Experiment 5:

*Do something to get significantly better or worse results*

Position

Start: (1, 1, 0)

End: (1.75, 1.0, 0)


I generated significant slip between the tires and the floor by putting a weight in front of the turtlebot and driving at a high speed.
